# song_desk

- Plays backing and beat for some songs.
- Sequences sampled notes rather than MIDI.

- Ultimately to create, arrange, transpose songs.

## TODO

- pitch bend (or use soft bass samples - no 'cause there's even less of them)
- Stop button play next pause
- store last played song
- bassline?
- note duration
    Never Leave Me Lonely
- BAss
-   Enjoy the Silence

- Repeats, key changes
-   Golden Lady


- song tempo - would want save? - perhaps do in separate file.
- piano octave 0 & 7 is missing some letters
- bass octave 3 is missing some letters
