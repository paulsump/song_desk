# song_desk

- Plays backing and beat for some songs.
- Sequences sampled notes rather than MIDI.

- Ultimately to create, arrange, transpose songs.

## TODO

- Stop button play next pause
- store last played song
- bassline?

- BAss
-   Enjoy the Silence

- Repeats, key changes
-   Golden Lady


- song tempo - would want save? - perhaps do in separate file.
