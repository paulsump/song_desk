- Plays backing and beat for some songs.
- Sequences sampled notes rather than MIDI.

- Ultimately to create, arrange, transpose songs.

## TODO

- note duration for reggae strum
- fix all bass lines in mel
  
  Another Star
  
- Stop button play next pause
- store last played song

- Repeats, key changes
-   Golden Lady


- song tempo - would want save? - perhaps do in separate file.
- piano octave 0 & 7 is missing some letters
