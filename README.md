# song_desk

- Plays backing and beat for some songs.
- Sequences sampled notes rather than MIDI.

- Ultimately to create, arrange, transpose songs.

## TODO

- tempo
  
- reggae strum 'ching' chords (arp) - already there in pandeiroOffset!
  
- Stop button play next pause
- store last played song

- Repeats, key changes
-   Golden Lady


- song tempo - would want save? - perhaps do in separate file.
- piano octave 0 & 7 is missing some letters
